"""What is 'a' in Python?"""
a,b = 20,30


"""if/else"""
if a < b:
    print('smaller')
elif a > b:
    print('bigger')
else:
    print('equal')


"""ternary"""
x = "smaller" if a<b else "bigger"

"""tuple"""

"""Obvious drawback is ternary and tuple can only handle one condition, 
but I keep seeing the tuple in the answer to problem sets"""
